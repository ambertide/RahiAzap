                    <p>Following our recent discoveries in the house and archives of the poet Abdülhak Hamit Tahran, we have came into conclusion of the existence of a lost piece of media with anomalous properties and possible danger to public.</p>
                    <p>The following article is for internal dissemination within the Department of Anomalous Artefacts only, and discusses the nature of our findings.</p>

                    <h3>Rah-ı Azâp</h3>
                    <p>Abdülhak Hamit Tahran has long been hailed as a great poet, especially during his active period in Tanzimat, his magnum opus was told to be Makber, a poem he wrote following the passing of her beloved wife.</p>
                    <p>What is lesser known about this author, is the fact that he is also a playwright. In fact, he had written over twenty different plays in his life, his last one (still unpublished), was finished ten days before his death.</p>
                    <p>As Makber is his magnum opus, it must come as no surprise that, it later turned out he wrote another, much more cryptic work. In a string of letters that was exchanged between Alexander Palm, a Russian author and Tahran, the poet discusses his latest work.</p>
                    <quote> I am thankful for your concern Palm, but as great is my loss, a single poem cannot extinguish a hearth in flames. My next work, I can feel, is much more impacted with my grief than the poem I wrote. <br><br> I call it Rah-ı Azâp, in my language, this means the Road of Anguish, and I can say the works of your poet friend has impacted me greatly, particularly of the Omsk Chapter, and what you have found there.</quote>

                <p> The poem in question can only be a reference to Makber, and hence, we can conclude that this is taking place sometime in 1885. Furthermore, the novelist friend mentioned is likely no other than Sergei Durov, a friend of Palm's and also, a close associate of no other than Fyodor Dostoevsky, though, we are yet to find letters from Palm to Tahran. </p>
                <p>Tahran concluded his work and sent it to the owner of an Istanbul theatre, who, reportedly, accepted to stage the play, without even reading the script, it is around that time, Palm passed away. But before this happened, he was assigned to a duty in the London Embassy of the Empire, whereupon arriving in London, his letters changed in tone, and his unexplained correspondence with Durov stopped.</p>
                <p> Upon being inquired by the owner of the theatre about the time of the premiere of his play, Tahran noted that he simply had no recollection of writing the script. This made Nazım Hüsnü Bey, the owner, extremely furious, Nazım would later write to one of his friends about the event, and seems to have believed that Abdülhak Hamit Tahran had duped him.</p>
                <p> Hüsnü Bey decided then, to take action, believing Tahran would not hear of the preparations before it was too late, he decided to stage the play anyhow, and thus, on October 13, 1886 a new play by Abdülhak Hamit Tahran was staged on an Istanbul theatre.</p>
                <p> Twelve members of the cast died in a string of suicides the theatre itself would burn next year, and the audience, when inquired for details of the play, would be unable to answer and showed signs of distress.</p>
                <h3>The Omsk Circle</h3>
                <p>We must now go into a tangent, before furthering the story of Tahran, and concentrate on another aspect of Tahran's original letter to Sergei Durov. For in that letter, Tahran mentions the 'Omsk Chapter'. We know that Sergei Durov, together with Dostoevsky was imprisoned in the notorious prison camp in Omsk, Siberia for their role in a secret society called the Petrashevsky Circle.</p>
                <p>In common historical telling of the story, Petrashevsky Circle was one of numerous literary and revolutionary groups dotting the failing Russian Empire, their leader believed the revolution was incoming and they would play a role in it. When the group was discovered, they were arrested, they were led to believe that their execution was imminent and in fact, three of the members were tied to the poles and soldiers took aim, only at the last second, a messenger arrived, bringing news from the tsar that they were forgiven, and would instead be banished to Siberia.</p>
                <p>Following their mock execution and gruelling exile in Siberia, of the twenty or so members that made up the circle, only two survived. Durov and Dostoevsky. Although, Durov would die young, and Dostoevsky would have a life plagued with gambling addiction, depression and alcoholism. </p>

                <p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, Anomalous community were given access to sources from inside Russia for the first time since our modern inception. In the archives of the Novosibirsk Federal Archives for Extranormal Affairs, they discovered a letter from Sergei Durov to Alexander Palm, in it, Durov details his life in Omsk, a section of particular importance, however, is when he mentions Dostoevsky.</p>
                <quote> Ever since we have heard of the demise of others Fyodor is inconsolable, I would not use the word "mad", but he is not himself anymore, I am afraid his mental state has deteriorated considerably, he had became attached to the testament even more, which is expected of a man of his religious background, but he seems to be convinced that he is haunted, and not in his usual metaphorical sense.</quote>
                <p>This letter, written sometimes in 1853, portrays a very depressing image of Dostoevsky. A few months later, in another letter to Palm, Durov writes the following:</p>
                <quote> I inquired further, pushing him to answer my question, I asked him why was he so adamant that he was haunted. Fyodor looked at me and said only that "the Legion wishes to speak through the mouth of the damned." I asked him further for details but he spoke not much, only mentioning that, "They wish to open the road.</quote>
                <p>It is possible that, here Dostoevsky, being a devout Orthodox mentions the Legion not in a military sense, but as the name of a demon or group of demons Jesus cast away in the Bible, as the story is told in the Gospel of Luke:</p>
                <quote> What is your name?” He said, “Legion”; for many demons had entered him. They begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss. Now there on the hillside a large herd  of swine was feeding; and the demons begged Jesus to let them enter  these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and  entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</quote>
                <p>The Legion's identity is hinted strongly as the being Dostoevsky was convinced he was haunted by in a diary entry he wrote that was cut out from his book on Omsk "From the House of the Death" by his editors, discovered in 1967 by the Soviet Institute of Anomalous Research. Dated twenty years after the fact, Dostoevsky wrote:</p>
                <quote> The human spirit is the most ingenious, there I believed, strongly that, I was haunted by a being, an old being that came from a land now under Turkish rule, but before, in the time of our Lord was under Roman rule. A being whose wish of not being sent to the Abyss they deserved was accepted by our most merciful Lord, and I was convinced that they had wanted to use me to speak, to enact their will. For in madness and anguish, lies the path to Hell.</quote>
                <p>We now know that, shortly after sending his second letter to Palm, Durov convinced Dostoevsky to speak up about his beliefs and learned of this. And we know, through Durov's journals that although initially convinced he eventually came to believe Dostoevsky, later writing to Palm, once again:</p>
                <quote> He is, and has always been, one of our smartest. I believe that, even though I let him believe otherwise, he is, in fact haunted in a way from something that once lurked in the Abyss. I gathered all the material I could find, here, in Omsk I will stay and work as a soldier, there are monasteries I can reach, priests I can speak. I started a journal where I keep the information about the what I came to call the Path, I strongly believe that there is a way to use the oppression of the Tsar against him.</quote>
                <p>After Dostoevsky returned to Moscow in 1854, Durov stayed behind as a soldier in the Imperial army, deteriorating day by day due to a mysterious illness, at the time, this was blamed on the condition at the Omsk Prison. He retired due to ill health and moved to Palm's house in 1860s, where his condition deteriorated further, eventually, in 1869, he died. In fifteen years later, in 1885, shortly after Tahran sent his letter to Palm, police would find Palm dead in his chair, in the chimney was group of letters and a journal whose contents were burnt to a crisp.</p>

                <p>Tahran learns of the Rah-ı Azâp's premiere three months later, when a distraught Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appeared in the Ottoman Embassy at London. Doyle was a spiritualist, and as one of the founders of the spiritualist movement in Britain, he was notified of the events in Istanbul through Edmund Dawson Rogers, a journalist who was, at the time, sending reports to the London Times about the reaction to the British Occupation of Egypt. Rogers was an associate of the Doyle through their mutual involvement in the Society of Psychic Research, a group that aimed to research spiritual phenomena through science.</p>
                <p>Sir Doyle was worried about the Rah-ı Azâp's unusual properties, when Tahran insisted he was unaware of the play at all, his worries only increased. Despite the protests of Tahran, Doyle insisted they discussed the issue further, at least somehow acquiring the script of the play, reluctantly, Tahran agreed. When the original script arrived from Istanbul, mailed in begrudgingly by the theatre owner Nazım Bey, Tahran quickly realised it was indeed his writing. Doyle retells to story to a letter to Louisa Hawkins, his wife:</p>
                <quote> Upon acquiring the copy, Tahran was initially disinterested, but once he saw the handwriting in the pages that was clearly his, the man I saw in front of me was visibly got smaller, he was shaken, and though once he stood adamant befitting of the officer of a great empire, Tahran, in that moment, I think decided on two things, that we must return to his estate in Basra at once to track down the origins of Rah-ı Azâp and second that he would trust me in this endeavour, at least to some extent.</quote>
                <p>When Nazım did not return their mails and telegraphs, Doyle and Tahran booked a compartment in the Orient Express with the aim of reaching Istanbul to talk with Nazım face to face, Tahran also made arrangements to stay at a friends house and ordered his servants in the Basra Estate to send his papers there, all the while they tried reaching to Nazmi Bey, their pleas however fell to deaf ears, the telegraphs went unanswered. Nazmi Bey journals revealed that he was feeling deceived by Tahran.</p>
                <quote> The Grand Poet decided to finally reclaim his work which he abandoned prior, and wishes to throw me aside. But I promised myself fame, I promised myself success, we will live.</quote>
                <p>It was January 7, 1887 when Tahran and Doyle reached Istanbul, two days after the latest staging of Rah-ı Azâp, they found Nazım's Theatre was shut down. Upon inquiries, they concluded that the play was indeed staged there two days prior, and Nazım fired all of the staff the next day, hence the boarded state of theatre, no one had seen the man in the days since, albeit, when they used Tahran's position as an official of the empire, they were able to conclude Nazım was making his way to the east and had boarded a ship to Beirut, wishing to follow in Nazım's footsteps, they too booked a ship en route to Beirut, the closest of which would be a month later.</p>
                <p>It was within this time frame Tahran and Doyle combed through the letters between Palm and Tahran, and reached many of the same conclusion we did. Doyle was particularly helpful in this endeavour as he had contacts in London's publishing scene who provided him with translations of Dostoevsky's "From the House of the Dead", some of which included the section about the demon Legion. Although Doyle was adamant it must be the Legion that was responsible for the anomalous properties of Rah-ı Azâp, Tahran was not convinced yet, using his status, he was able to gain access to the theatre, in Nazım's Office, they found his journals. These journals were preserved by Tahran later on.</p>
                <quote> Ever since the second show, there is an ache in my hearth, something sitting on top, a feeling, burning, heavy. I have a wish in my mind, a wish to travel, a name. A city that once was, Gadara. I never heard of its name before, in no maps I look it appears, but it calls me nonetheless, somewhere in Damascus... The wish becomes unstoppable, like a sickness, a hunger that cannot be stopped, I must go there, no. I must return there.</quote>
                <p>Tahran, now at least willing to entertain the idea, and Doyle than conversed with members of the Orthodox Church in the city, believing the passages to be connected to Legion, the priest they contacted informed that Gadara was possibly referring to the "country of Gadarenes" in the Gospel of Luke and would be located near the Galilee where the Legion had drowned in the Bible. Upon receiving this information, and referring to the Byzantine archives located in the Ottoman Palace, the duo ascertained that Gadara should be located in Umm Qais.</p>
                <p>Tahran and Doyle boarded their ship to Beirut, and made their way to Umm Qais on horseback, a journey that took more than two weeks to complete. When they finally arrived in the village, they surveyed the area, and upon reaching a peak looking over to the Sea of Galilee they found Nazım's body, and in his hands, a note, scribbled in a weak state.</p>
                <quote> I was blinded, the promises of fame and money, the promises it made. You don't realise it isn't your thoughts. It is their thoughts, their wishes, their promises. Too late now, it roars inside me, howls with excitement as we make our way to its resting place, there, it will be set free, there, when the thirteenth member dies, it will be set free.</quote>
                <p>They took the body of Nazım to the nearby Beit al-Rousan, the house of the wealthy Rousan family, whom were merchants, they helped the duo bury Nazım according to Islamic practices, and let them stay in their house for the night. Tahran would write of the moment they found Nazım thus:</p>
                <quote> I knew it before we reached the peak. I knew it since we set sail from the Capital. In the hill, when I saw Nazım, I was relieved more than anything, relieved that his pain was over, relieved that he was, in a way, free. It was dark there, even in the middle of the noon, not "dark" in the traditional sense, no. It was something else, a presence that lingered in the air, contrasted by a feeling of holiness, since, it must have also been where Prophet Isa stood once. <br><br> Yet, looking at the Sea of Galilee, it was impossible to ignore the darkness that laid underneath, something that is beyond my understanding, there was something alive there. Something that was exiled by the Prophet once, something that promised things to anyone who listened, their hearts content. To Dostoevsky, it must be freedom, to Durov and Palm, Revolution and to Nazım, it must be fame. I was not among those whom he, or perhaps, they, talked to, propagating through my writing, used me as a conduit, and through palm it found his way. <br><br> Then, they must have used the life forces of the cast and Nazım, thirteen actors a mockery of the thirteen disciples, a ritual? A mockery? I wouldn't know, but they are here now, under the Sea of Galilee, waiting. Beyond me, beyond Doyle, beyond us all.</quote>
